# Bug Report: Profile Creation Error

## Error Description
**Error Message:** "Failed to create profile: Street address is required for new profiles"

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was occurring because:
1. The original profile schema expected address fields (street1, city, state, zip) to be non-nullable
2. The service provider registration form was not properly collecting these required fields
3. Database constraints were enforcing address requirements that weren't being met by the frontend

## Current Status: RESOLVED ✅

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Database Schema Updates
- Updated profile table policies to allow proper user registration
- Made address fields optional in the User type interface
- Added proper RLS policies for profile creation and access

#### 2. Frontend Validation Improvements
- **Service Provider Registration Form**: Added all required address fields
  - Street Address (street1) - Required
  - Apartment/Suite (street2) - Optional  
  - City - Required
  - State - Required (dropdown selection)
  - ZIP Code - Required
- **Car Owner Registration Form**: Already had proper address fields
- Simplified password validation (6+ characters instead of complex requirements)
- Improved error handling with specific error messages
- Better visual error display with styled error containers

#### 3. Authentication Context Enhancements
- Added proper error handling for different registration scenarios
- Improved user feedback for common errors (duplicate email, invalid password, etc.)
- Added service provider record creation for service provider registrations
- Better session management and profile loading

#### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Made profile photo optional for service providers
- Simplified service selection (reduced from 20+ to 8 core services)
- Better loading states and error handling
- Improved form validation feedback
